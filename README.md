# Fanshawe Industry Night 2025
***

### Background
This is a Hackathon project for the Semester 3 IDP program. Our team is required to create a web page to promote the upcoming event for Level 4 students to showcase their work to potential clients. The Industry Night also features the Brothers In Arms Memorial project and the personal portfolio of each student. 

The repo is for demonstrating how to set up the project with branching.
